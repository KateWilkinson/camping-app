         <div class="range range-success">
            <input type="range" name="range" min="1" max="100" value="50" onchange="rangeSuccess.value=value">
            <output id="rangeSuccess">50</output>
          </div>

          // use jquery to getelement by id? need to somehow access the id rangeSuccess and use that as a filter. makes sense to do this with jquery but how would that fit in with the existing search - unless advanced search was entirely js.
