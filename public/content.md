The yurt is 20 feet in diameter and styled by a designer to include: a king-sized bed and luxury cotton linen; sofas and bean bags; soft lighting and exterior candlelit lanterns; en-suite bathrooms, featuring a roll top bath and that all-important flushing loo, plus a private terrace decking with stunning views.

At night, guests can listen for nocturnal animals in their natural habitat –before being lulled to sleep by the sounds of the wind rustling in the trees and the waves gently breaking on the beach.
